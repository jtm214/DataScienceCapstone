https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets

Disclaimer: Express consent was provided by Red Eléctrica de España (source and proprietary of the data) to gather the data using web scraping under the framework of a practicum from the Master in Data Science from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC). Under no circumstance do they support the reuse of the data. We express our intention to use the data for the purpose of the activity and decline any commercial interest in the use of the data extracted.

The data sets are included here because both sites require login and it was just easier to do this.

## Notes
- The .RData file was saved because this is used in the markdown file so that I didn't have to run a whole bunch of code there and it made knitr run very quickly.  If you plan on running the markdown file you must include this in the same directory.
- The project file was included just for my purposes but should not be needed to run the application.
- The data .csv files are located in the github repo so please make sure you have a network connection before running the .R script or things will fail.
