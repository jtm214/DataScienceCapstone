# HarvardX data science capstone project
This repo contains two different projects 1) MoveLens/MovieRecommender which is a guided project starting with code provided in the course with the goal of getting results less than RMSE of 0.86490 and
2) a self-guided project that I've yet to complete.  This is currently a public repository so the files can be accessed by anybody.  This will change in the near future as it will be converted to a 
private repo once the crading has been completed.

## Guided MovieLens project
This repo contains the three files necessary for completing the project, a .R file, .Rmd file, and pdf document created using knitr.  The files are located in the MovieRecommender folder.

## Independent projects
TBD
