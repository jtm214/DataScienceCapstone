# HarvardX data science capstone project
This repo contains two different projects 1) MoveLens/MovieRecommender which is a guided project starting with code provided in the course with the goal of getting results less than RMSE of 0.86490 and
2) a self-guided project that I've yet to complete.  This is currently a public repository so the files can be accessed by anybody.  This will change in the near future as it will be converted to a 
private repo once the crading has been completed.

## Guided MovieLens project
This repo contains the three files necessary for completing the project, a .R file, .Rmd file, and pdf document created using knitr.  The files are located in the MovieRecommender folder.

## Independent projects
This repo contains the choose your own project for the capstone course.  It contains multiple files, the required files - .R file, .Rmd file, and pdf document, as well as the data sets used in the course (energyData.csv and tempData.csv), the project file and the workspace data used in knitr.  The files are located in the ChooserYourOwn folder.
